#Odin Recipes
This repository (will contain) contains a basic website with links to recipes. The purpose of writing this website
is to apply skills that I have learned in writing html. I will use the boilerplate template which I have memorized 
to start off the main page, and I will write various elements (and most likeley some attributes) which will make up
the webpage. Some elements applied will include paragraphs, headers, links, and images. Each element will consist of
the opening/closing tag, the content, and (optionally) the attributes contained in the opening tags.
